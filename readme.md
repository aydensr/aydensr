I am a tech nerd. I diagnose, upgrade, and perform routine maitenance on PCs.
I am a linux enthusiast. I am not good with linux by any means, but I can get my way in a command line only envirnment, although it may not be my favorate.
I am learning to code in C, Mainly because "it is the language of the UNIX operating system" and also because theororetically, from C I can more easily
learn C++, C#, Objective-C, and Rust.
I am new to Github so please excuse my lack of knowledge in the code maintaning space.
